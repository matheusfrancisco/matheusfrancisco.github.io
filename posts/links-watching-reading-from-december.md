Disclaimer: I'm not english guy, so my grammar is not the best in the world, just keep in mind i'm improve it. Also everything is not related with My work, because I work 8 hrs day for a company based on brasil and I did in the December after hours.
## What is the December Dumps? #1 #[[Dec 29th Done Dump]]

This is for me first of all, I was using a app called logseq to my daily notes, and I was looking for things I had already read or study. 
So if I write I can remember more. What is this idea it is basic #learning-how-to-learn or #learning-in-public, but this came into 
my mind when I stumbled with this https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public which was send to me by https://rafael.delboni.cc/ than 
I came with this. I will try to write few words in the end of each month about big topics I've had read and may dump some github 
repositories, and also I will create a roadmap about the next writings I will do and you can ask me anything about the topics or ask for codes if I did post it yet.

## What are the big topics I'm studying.

I'm studying **distributed-systems**, **Compilers** ,**Computer Science** in general,
**Algorithms and Data Structure** (Graphs, Tree, Algorithms Sorting, Greedy, Dynamic Programming) 
and I will post something about some https://leetcode.com I solved. There are some **Books** I finished 
I will recommend, also there are some books I will just mention as read, I will include some #open-source 
links I've contrib. some **Side Projects** I'm working on. I also like programming languages so it will have
something about **Clojure and Clojurescript**, **Rust**, **Zig**, **C and Cpp Study** and sometimes python. 
It will have more  clojure because I've work with clojure so I'm studying more about this language.

## Links
Open source contribs 
- I contrib with open-source at [moclojer](https://github.com/moclojer/moclojer/pull/209)
