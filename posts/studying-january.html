<h2 id="january&#95;study&#95;topics">January study topics</h2><p>This month I was looking for improve some knowledge about Algorithms, Data Structure and Distribute Systems, also start put my foot in some fields again as calculus (limits) and linear algebra to get a path to the beautiful world of AI and LLM.</p><p>So I Started doing so far for Algorithms and Data Structure, this is not a recommendation it is what I'm doing here is All problem I solved from leetcode https://github.com/matheusfrancisco/playground.programming but so far it was  <img src="../assets/image_1706520749939_0.png" alt="image.png" /></p><p>Also I start watch the course from MIT https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/ from this I may post something or create some repository but my main focus it will be on the classes and maybe do some exercises.</p><p>About distribute system it is the same thing I started a course from MIT https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html also it will be something I may create some post.</p><p>and I start learning more about LLM and AI but I felt I needed more about math to understand better so I'm finishing a calculus and linear algebra course this one I donÂ´t know how ca I post but may add some things.</p><p>att Chico</p><p>chico@matheusfrancisco.com.br</p>
