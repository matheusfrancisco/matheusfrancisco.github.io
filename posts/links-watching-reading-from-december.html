<p>Disclaimer: I'm not english guy, so my grammar is not the best in the world, just keep in mind i'm improve it. Also everything is not related with My work, because I work 8 hrs day for a company based on brasil and I did in the December after hours.<h2 id="what&#95;is&#95;the&#95;december&#95;dumps?&#95;#1&#95;#[[dec&#95;29th&#95;done&#95;dump]]">What is the December Dumps? #1 #[[Dec 29th Done Dump]]</h2></p><p>This is for me first of all, I was using a app called logseq to my daily notes, and I was looking for things I had already read or study.  So if I write I can remember more. What is this idea it is basic #learning-how-to-learn or #learning-in-public, but this came into  my mind when I stumbled with this https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public which was send to me by https://rafael.delboni.cc/ than  I came with this. I will try to write few words in the end of each month about big topics I've had read and may dump some github  repositories, and also I will create a roadmap about the next writings I will do and you can ask me anything about the topics or ask for codes if I did post it yet.</p><h2 id="what&#95;are&#95;the&#95;big&#95;topics&#95;i'm&#95;studying.">What are the big topics I'm studying.</h2><p>I'm studying <strong>distributed-systems</strong>, <strong>Compilers</strong> ,<strong>Computer Science</strong> in general, <strong>Algorithms and Data Structure</strong> (Graphs, Tree, Algorithms Sorting, Greedy, Dynamic Programming)  and I will post something about some https://leetcode.com I solved. There are some <strong>Books</strong> I finished  I will recommend, also there are some books I will just mention as read, I will include some #open-source  links I've contrib. some <strong>Side Projects</strong> I'm working on. I also like programming languages so it will have something about <strong>Clojure and Clojurescript</strong>, <strong>Rust</strong>, <strong>Zig</strong>, <strong>C and Cpp Study</strong> and sometimes python.  It will have more  clojure because I've work with clojure so I'm studying more about this language.</p><h2 id="links">Links</h2><p>Open source contribs </p><ul><li>I contrib with open-source at <a href='https://github.com/moclojer/moclojer/pull/209'>moclojer</a></li><li>also code in moclojer-app which is a moclojer cloud (it will came soon)</li><li>Also did a commit at logseq https://github.com/logseq/logseq/pull/10018</li><li>create this blog https://github.com/matheusfrancisco/berry </li></ul><p>Books I read</p><ul><li>Ultra learning which is the best book I've read this year by scott young</li><li>Build a second brain</li></ul><p>I will not explain every link but I recommend some of them with the tag <strong>#good-read</strong></p><ul><li>DONE https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying learning more about log (database log) <strong>#good-read</strong></li><li>DONE Learning more about fp  https://youtu.be/nuML9SmdbJ4?si=lnhuCLoWwQd0J6iv which is a nice video about it</li><li>Learning how to compile clojurescript https://github.com/matheusfrancisco/poc.cljs-export-to-js and import into a react app and also import into node runtime.</li></ul><p>Distributed Systems</p><ul><li>Start the course [[MIT 6.824 Distributed Systems (Spring 2020)]] and read about <a href='https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse547/17sp/content/Downloads/p107-dean.pdf'>mapreduce</a> and rpc, threadings. <strong>#good-read</strong></li><li>DONE https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf  Read paper RAFT consensus algorithms<ul><li>Algorithm <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro2fU8_mr2w'>Raft - The understandable Distributed Protocol</a></li><li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IujMVjKvWP4&t=25s'>Understand RAFT without breaking your brain</a></li><li>Read paper kafka start implement some parts of the paper to understanding more about kafka https://notes.stephenholiday.com/Kafka.pdf</li><li><a href='https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2745385'>There is No Now - ACM Queue</a>   </li></ul></li></ul><p>Learning more about compilers</p><ul><li>Starting the book [[Crafting Interpreters]] (did not finished yet, but I start the compiler implementation will write about compilers in a specific post) <strong>#good-read</strong></li><li>learning about clojurescript compiler with this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elg17s_nwDg <strong>#good-read</strong>.
